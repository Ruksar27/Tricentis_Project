# Tricentis_Project
The Tricentis Insurant Vehicle project focuses on automating the testing processes for a vehicle insurance application using Selenium WebDriver. This project aims to ensure the application's functionality, reliability, and performance through comprehensive automated testing strategies.

Project Overview
The Tricentis Insurant Vehicle project utilizes Selenium to automate end-to-end testing of the vehicle insurance application. The primary goal is to validate user interactions, data processing, and overall application behavior in various scenarios, ensuring that all features perform as expected under different conditions.
Key Features
End-to-End Testing: The project covers critical user journeys within the vehicle insurance application, including quote generation, policy management, and customer information updates.
Selenium WebDriver: Employed for automating browser interactions, allowing for the simulation of real user behavior on the web application.
TestNG Framework: Utilized for organizing test cases, managing test execution, and providing detailed reporting capabilities.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports various input scenarios through external data sources (e.g., CSV or Excel files), enhancing test coverage and flexibility.

Technologies Used
Selenium WebDriver: The primary tool for automating web application testing.
Java: The programming language used for writing test scripts.
TestNG: A testing framework that provides advanced features such as parallel execution and dependency management.
Maven: Used for project management and dependency resolution.

Testing Scenarios
The project includes a variety of testing scenarios such as:
Navigating to the insurance quote page and entering user information.
Generating quotes based on different vehicle types and coverage options.
Validating the accuracy of quotes against expected values.
Updating customer information and verifying changes in the system.
Testing error handling by submitting invalid data.

Execution and Reporting
Tests are executed using Maven commands, which compile the test classes and run the TestNG test suite. After execution, detailed reports are generated that provide insights into test results, including passed/failed tests and any errors encountered during execution.

Benefits
By implementing this automation project, organizations can achieve significant improvements in their software testing processes. The use of Selenium allows for faster test execution cycles, reduced manual testing efforts, and increased reliability in detecting defects early in the development lifecycle. This ultimately leads to higher quality software releases and improved customer satisfaction in the vehicle insurance domain.
